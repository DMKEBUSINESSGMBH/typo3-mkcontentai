# MK Content AI

"mkcontentai" is a powerful TYPO3 extension that leverages the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to generate high-quality images for your website. By connecting to both the OpenAI API and stablediffusionapi.com API, this extension provides an intuitive image generation tool that allows you to easily create custom images by simply providing a prompt.

This makes it easy to incorporate the generated images into your website or web application, without the need for any additional steps or plugins.
